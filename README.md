# React App using Firebase

A chat application using the React Js libraries with Firebase for the backend.
SCSS was delved into deeper (compared with first chat application using ChatEngine.io) to
create custom stylings. Firebase-specific functions were learned during the process. 
More experience with creating AuthContext and further experimentation using react hooks were explored.

We later deployed the app to our Netlify account here: https://chat-app-react-firebase-pomeranian.netlify.app/
